### About RYDES
Rydes allows companies to provide their employees with a "mobility budget" with which they can use all modes of inner-city mobility. For this purpose, the startup bundles existing mobility offers in one app. The company employees can book trips with car and bike sharing, e-scooters, shared cabs, or public transport services via the app and manage their budget.

On top of that, RYDES offsets the company's CO2 emissions with its partner offsetAPI by supporting one of 30 gold certified choosable offset projects.

LIH spun off the startup RYDES in February 2021. Porsche and the Lufthansa Group are strategic minority shareholders in the startup.
